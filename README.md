# Splatoon 3 Stage Layout Editor
A Stage Layout viewer for Splatoon 3! (Made using KillzX's Sample-Editor & Sheldon's Splatoon 2 Editor Fork)

## Todo:
- Logic (.ainb) reading/editing
- Environment editor (FieldEnv, RenderingDay/Night, Ocean etc)

## Feel free to make pull requests about new features, changes, bug fixes etc.

## Libraries
- GLFrameworkEngine : A 3D engine used for manipulating 3D opengl data with gizmo tools, selection handling, ray casting, and much more. This also includes various helper classes to handle OpenGL easier.  
- Map Studio UI : The UI engine used to display this editor running off imgui. 
- Toolbox.Core : A small, portable backend used for file IO to read/write data along with commonly shared things like texture swizzling and decoding.
